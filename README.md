# Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Ensure your repository is connected to GitHub and the `main` branch is up to date.
2. Run `npm install` (once) to grab dependencies including `gh-pages`.
3. Build and publish the latest site with `npm run deploy`. This runs `npm run build` and pushes the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch via the `gh-pages` CLI.
4. In your GitHub repository settings, set GitHub Pages to serve from the `gh-pages` branch (root).
5. After GitHub finishes publishing, your portfolio will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.
